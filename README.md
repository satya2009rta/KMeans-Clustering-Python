# KMeans Clustering using Jaccard Distance and tf-idf Distance
## Short description of code
We have a function *loadData* for loading the dataset from the file to main memory. We also calculate the tf-idf values in this function. We calculate the Jaccard Distance between two documents in the function *jaccardDistance* and tf-idf distance in the function *tf_idfDistance*. The function *findCentroid* calculates centroids for a given set of clusters. For each cluster it calculates it's centroid by adding those terms in the centroid that occur more than 50% of the times and then returns the nearest document to it in the cluster as it's centroid. In the function *kmeans*, we calculate the clusters for given centroids and then it uses *findCentroid* to calculate new centroids for the given clusters. Then we take this new centroids to again calculate the clusters and continue the process for certain number of iterations. We have the function *initialSeeds* that finds the initial set of centroids chosen randomly. In the *main* method, we are calling the functions for both Jaccard and tf-idf and printing the clusters obtained. We took constants MAX_ITERATION for the number of iteraions in kmeans, K_VALUE that specifies the number of centroids and DATASET that gives the input file name. For each DATASET we tried running the code for different K_VALUE and MAX_ITERATION.
